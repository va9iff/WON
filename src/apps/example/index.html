<body>
    full page. most of the things will probably unnecessary such as seo tags. <br>
    but we use page so implementing an existing one won't be that hard. <br>
    <style>
        div{
            background-color: crimson;
            border: 5px dashed blue;
        }
    </style>
    as they are iframes, we can use encapsulated styles
    <div>
        it's so nice to style a div selector for just one page
    </div>
