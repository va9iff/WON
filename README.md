WONOS
=====
## Your computer 1 sign-in away, not just files.  
#### [Try](https://va9iff.github.io/WON/)
The biggest advantage of using WONOS over a standard cloud file storage is that 
WONOS lets you actually use that file in a desktop real operating system like 
environment. It offers apps that you can use to edit and work on your files on 
the fly!  
You can still use your wished cloud storage. WONOS will be able to integrate to 
that and let you use and modify the files from itself. Its app ecosystem and 
modularity opens the doors for unlimited creativity.  
### All you need is just a browser and then you can do almost everything you do with your own computer.
It's worth to mention that we are not trying to make an operating system that runs on browser. We make a platform to utilize your files other than "just available to download" and offer it all open source <3
